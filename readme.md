# SF crime data to geojson

The goal of this is to get the data from the San Francisco data portal into a format that is usable to people who just want a geojson object and not to worry about parsing stuff.

For an example of use see the example usemod.js file in the example directory to see how to make a call, parse the data and then write the geojson to a file.
